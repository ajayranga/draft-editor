# Assignment

You need to create an editor using Draft.js within ReactJS with the following specifications:

- There are three main components in the layout: Title, Button and Editor

- The editor needs to be written in Draft.js
  - Typing `#` as the first string in a line & pressing space should make anything you type afterward on the same line be in a “Heading 1” format. On pressing space, the aforementioned `#` should disappear.
    - See “This is a heading” line in the layout image above.
  - Similarly, typing `*` as the first string in a line and pressing space should correspond to “bold” format
  - `**` and space = red line
  - `***` and space = underline
  - [**Optional**][**Extra points]\*\* If you can add a highlighted code block when the user types ````` and space.
- Pressing `Save` button should persist everything typed in the editor into `localstorage`. On refreshing the page, the saved info should be refilled into the editor.
- Please try your best to make the UI look clean and pleasing
